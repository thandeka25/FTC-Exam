# Question 1.5

Currently there is no regulation governing the organic food certification system in South Africa. However, A state auditor mechanism is applicable with respect the use of the term “free range” on animal products. This means that any animal-based products on the platform that are labelled as free range would have to adhere to the requirements. FoodPrint would have to inform the farmers of this as the farmers as in charge of uploading data on the platform about them and their produce.  This is also in line with the consumer act requirements as the farmers would have to ensure that the customers are receiving what has been described. 
The Agricultural Product Standards Act provides for the Biodynamic and Organic Certification Authority (BDOCA), which was set up to regulate and control the sale of organic products. The Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) requires a certificate issued by an organic certification organization that is accepted in the country of destination to accompany organic shipments. If FoodPrint is to expand to on-boarding farmers with a focus on overseas markets then they will have to make sure that the farmers align with the requirements. 
FoodPrint as a platform is to ensure that their stance remains clear. At the beginning, they are not an e-commerce platform but a platform to share information amongst various stakeholders whilst providing value added services.
