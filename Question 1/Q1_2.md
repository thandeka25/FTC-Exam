# Question 1.2: 
Fashion Coin is an example of a company that does not need the blockchain. It aims to create a peer to peer marketplace for users via the blockchain. However, this is already taking place without the need for the blockchain. The customer and the designer do not need a shared database. The addition of a digital asset will increase the complexity for something that is used once off and usually by people within the same jurisdiction and therefore use the same currency.  
Also, with the custom garment industry, clients usually make multiple changes to the design before the final product is made and delivered. This goes against the blockchainâ€™s offering of no changes in the system at any point after a smart contract is deployed. Another point is that most transactions for custom garments are made between trusted individuals hence there is no need for a trustless environment. Also, the customer usually only interacts with the designer, who will take care of the production, thus there are no multiple parties involved. The transactions between customers and designers can take place successfully without the need for the blockchain.
